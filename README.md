# Product-Return-Analysis
 
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing product return patterns across regions, product categories, and reasons for return.
The goal is to help businesses identify the most common causes of returns, affected product lines, and trends over time.
By understanding these patterns, organizations can reduce return rates, improve product quality, and enhance customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objectives

Identify which regions and categories have the highest return rates.

Understand the reasons behind returns.

Track monthly return trends to spot irregularities.

Provide visual insights using stacked bar charts, donut charts, and line charts.
